          Hi! I'm Rohit Singh, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in the MERN stack, WordPress, and SEO.

        <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-6">
          Over the past year, I have worked on various projects, including a food ordering website, a job portal, and an Instagram-like social media platform. My work emphasizes clean code, responsive design, and optimized performance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-6">
          My journey into tech began from a non-IT background, and I've embraced every challenge to hone my skills in development, problem-solving, and teamwork. I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies to deliver cutting-edge web experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-7">
          When I’m not coding, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through my <a href="#" className="text-blue-500 underline">YouTube channel</a>, where I teach JavaScript, MERN stack, and WordPress concepts. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
